# My favourite music

I find choosing a list of favourite music a slightly daunting task. As with other things such as favourite film, colour or food, it varies from day to day. I don't want the same diet every day, nor to watch the same film over and over again, or to listen to the same music every day. So I'll start at the end, with the 3 tracks I would like to have played at my funeral. Does this seem strange? To me it's quite fitting.

### #1

First up is Freddie Mercury, and what better than "Who Wants To Live Forever", from the 1986 film _Highlander_. At this time he was already infected with AIDS and the end of his glittering career was beginning to come into view. Whether this song reflects the awareness of mortality so evident in later numbers cannot be known, but in any case it's a powerful piece.

There's no time for us  
There's no place for us  
What is this thing that builds our dreams  
Yet slips away from us?    
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  

There's no chance for us  
It's all decided for us  
This world has only one  
Sweet moment set aside for us  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who?    
Who dares to love forever  
Oh, when love must die?  

But touch my tears with your lips  
Touch my world with your fingertips  
And we can have forever  
And we can love forever  
Forever is our today  

Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Forever is our today  
Who waits forever anyway?

### #2

My second choice is "Still Crazy After All These Years", by the incomparable Paul Simon. It's an elegant, concise retrospective with beautiful lyrics.

I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh Still crazy after all these years  

I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  

Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade...  

Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

### #3

My third and final choice comes with a story. In July 1966 I was on holiday with my parents; a road trip across Europe to Austria then back via Italy and France. (See ~stid:Joan and Ron/Family Holidays:Family Holidays~) On the way we stopped somewhere in Germany and spent a couple of nights in  youth hostel. I remember nothing about that stop except that everywhere we went we heard the same piece of music playing from bars, restaurants and in the hostel; a haunting trumpet solo, the memory of which stayed with me ever since. Several times over the years I tried to identify the piece, which I took to be a particularly German thing since I'd never heard it in England, and I never succeeded. Of course, for most of that time there was no Internet, so no easy way to find this kind of information. All you could do was pick likely music experts and sing dah-di-dum-di-dah at them in the hope they might recognise the tune. Later, searches on the Internet for German trumpeters of that period came up with a number of names but no recording resembling that particular piece.

Then one day in November 2009 the BBC4 Time Shift series ran a programme called “The Last of the Liners”, a documentary about how the postwar liners gave way to cruise ships and travel by sea changed from being transport to leisure. An interesting programme in its own right but I wasn’t actually watching the TV when it started; I was in the computer room next door. What brought me in running was the first few scenes. Behind the presenter’s voice was that trumpet piece again, just as I remembered it, and a rush of old memories and impressions came flooding back. I stayed to watch the rest of the programme in the hope they might repeat the tune, but no, it was just that one scene.

This time, however, I wasn’t going to give up that easily; not with the resources of the World Wide Web at hand. I went to the BBC website and started searching for someone I could ask. Now I imagine the BBC must get an awful lot of emails and it’s difficult for them to respond to every crank and nut who blasts off a ten-page complaint, so they’ve basically pulled up the drawbridge. It’s actually pretty nigh impossible to find a “Contact Us” link that leads to a real person. There are a couple of forums but they get posts every few seconds (mostly about East Enders, it seems) so anything that isn’t picked up rapidly disappears into the void. And this was a question about BBC4, whose audience is much smaller, older and probably less likely to haunt forums than that of the main channels. Even Time Shift no longer has its own website and the trail ran cold.

However, the programme was re-run the following day so I recorded it then studied the credits and plugged the names of the producers into Google. And struck gold. The executive producer popped up in someone else’s FaceBook blog, a chess enthusiast telling his readers about a new programme being made where the producer was the chap I was searching for, and – most importantly – giving his email address at the Beeb. So  I wrote to him asking if he would be so kind as to help me identify the piece of music.

Within hours I had a reply from a production co-ordinator for the series, happy to help provide the answer I had been seeking for all those years. It seems that once you find a way past the front gate the BBC is populated by friendly and helpful people; truly a national asset. And then I discovered why my attempts to find a German trumpeter had failed; he was actually an Italian called Nini Rosso, and the number, “Il Silenzio”, was a hit in several countries including Italy and Germany. Of course, armed with this information the World Wide Web disgorges as much information as anyone could ask for.

Buona notte, amore    
Ti vedrò nei miei sogni    
Buona notte a te che sei lontano.

Good night, love    
I'll see you in my dreams    
Good night to you who are far away.

### Honourable mention

A close runner-up is "Ask the mountains", by Vangelis. This strangely haunting piece, with its barely discernable lyrics, always leaves me with a feeling of inner peace. One of the comments on the YouTube page says "_I always come back to this song when I wish to reconnect with the whole universe_". Another says "_I live and die at the same time... flying high on my wings each time I hear this! Thank you, Maestro Vangelis!_" That's about right.

Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Please don't follow me along  
When you read this I'll be gone  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in, to tell you why  
Ask the mountains  
Wild woods, highlands  
Ask the green in the woods and the trees  
The cold breeze coming in from the sea  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and…

## Other favourites

I have a fairly wide and eclectic taste in music, though I'm not a fan of harsh, jangly jazz or folk. Neither am I keen on music with too much of an insistent beat, so that rules out most "pop" music as well as oompah. The piano is probably my favourite instrument; solo guitar I find tedious and trumpets intrusive, though there are notable exceptions to all these, such as my third choice above. Lush orchestration and "pomp rock" sit somewhere near the top of my list. Queen, Pink Floyd and Genesis, definitely, while I don't much like shouty bands like Status Quo or heavy guitar rock.

I was brought up on classical music but seldom listen to it now, though there are pieces I still enjoy, particularly where classical merges into film themes. The [Warsaw Concerto](https://youtu.be/wbb-jozEdUQ), for example, and almost anything by Ennio Morricone, John Barry or of course Vangelis. The piano concerto is my favourite style of classical music, so Rachmaninov and Rubenstein are high on the list.

Here's a selection of tracks I would listen to over and over again:

## Music and emotion

I was reading about the opening performance in Vienna of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, reckoned by many to be among the most accomplished pieces of music ever written. At that time the composer was completely deaf, so the symphony is a remarkable achievement. During the performance, Beethoven, though not the conductor, was on stage conducting himself in a highly animated fashion, but he gradually drifted off-time because of his deafness. At the end he was still "conducting" and one of the solists gently turned him round to face the audience, on their feet, appluading and waving hankerchiefs for his benefit. It's a touching story.

The ability to "hear" music persists long after hearing is lost. Mine is partially gone, following a bout of flu in January 2017, and I find it hard to derive the same pleasure I once did from listening to recordings. However, my memories remain, to a remarkable level of fidelity, and with a good pair of headphones I can get close to re-experiencing what I remember.

I was thinking about what it is with certain pieces of music that trigger strong emotions in most of us. Different pieces for each person, of course, so I'd like to show some examples of what gives me a feeling of complete peace or even welling up. One I've already mentioned - the Vangelis track Ask The Mountains, but here are a few more, in no particular order.

First up is a Moody Blues number called The Question ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2lIbp1XYpM)). This was apparently two melodies stiched together by Justin Hayward because he couldn't make a complete track out of either of them. The two parts are of very different styles but for some strange reason work quite well together. The opening part is an up-tempo melody that's not particularly distinguished, but after a couple of verses it suddenly changes to the second theme, a much slower melody that's among the most beautiful of anything written by the band - or by anyone else for that matter. Both the melody and the lyrics are stunningly powerful and the piece is always a favorite of fans at live performances. If you never heard the track before, the second theme arrives as a complete surprise, so it's well worth playing the whole track or you'll miss the experience.

Next a Beatles number from their Abbey Road album. Golden Slumbers ([YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQjM7gV6mI&list=RDAMVMAcQjM7gV6mI)) is one of the set of  short tracks that run as a continuous sequence at the end of the album. It's only 90 seconds long and is followed by to the next track, Carry That Weight, which is more of a continuation. The first time I heard this track on a good-quality hi-fi system, a single bass note seemed to stand out and hit some kind of emotional button. I can't explain why it does it. In the second verse, a second after Paul sings "Once there was a way..." this note occurs as a form of musical punctuation. The same phrase is actually sung 4 times but there's something about the third one that's different. To me it arrives as a silent explosion, or a door slamming onto a pillow, causing an abrupt change of air pressure rather than a definite start to the note that follows. I doubt anyone else hears it that way, which makes it all rather inexplicable.

On the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side Of The Moon is The Great Gig In The Sky ([YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=mPGv8L3a_sY&list=RDAMVMmPGv8L3a_sY)), with music by Richard Wright and those fabulous, famous non-lexical vocals by Clare Torry. Non-lexical is a posh way of saying "no words"; it's an improvised wailing that's become a classic for generation after generation of fans. The story of how it happened, as much as anything by chance, can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gig_in_the_Sky).

The final track of the same album is Eclipse ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wjZrswriz0)), by Roger Waters, who described it as "a very simple statement saying that all the good things life can offer are there for us to grasp, but that the influence of some dark force in our natures prevents us from seizing them". The final lines

_And everything under the sun is in tune_    
_But the sun is eclipsed by the moon_

might seem depressing to some, but the song is rescued by a musical device called a Picardy Third, which substitutes a major key where a minor might be expected, leaving the final impression up-beat.

These four are just examples. I can never tell when a particular piece of music will trigger an emotional response, but some are almost guaranteed to do so.
