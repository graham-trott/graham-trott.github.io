# My favourite music

I find choosing a list of favourite music a slightly daunting task. As with other things such as favourite film, colour or food, it varies from day to day. I don't want the same diet every day, nor to watch the same film over and over again, or to listen to the same music every day. So I'll start at the end, with the 3 tracks I would like to have played at my funeral. Does this seem strange? To me it's quite fitting.

First up is "Ask the mountains", by Vangelis. This strangely haunting piece, with its barely discernable lyrics, always leaves me with a feeling of inner peace. One of the comments on the YouTube page says "_I always come back to this song when I wish to reconnect with the whole universe_". Another says "_I live and die at the same time... flying high on my wings each time I hear this! Thank you, Maestro Vangelis!_" That's about right.

Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Come  
Don't come after  
Don't come after  
Please don't follow me along  
When you read this I'll be gone  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Why couldn't this go on?  
Couldn't our happiness go on?  
Ask the sun that lightens up the sky  
When the night gives in, to tell you why  
Ask the mountains  
Wild woods, highlands  
Ask the green in the woods and the trees  
The cold breeze coming in from the sea  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs and fountains  
Ask the mountains  
Springs andâ€¦

My second choice is "Still Crazy After All These Years", by the incomparable Paul Simon. It's an elegant, concise retrospective with beautiful lyrics.

I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh Still crazy after all these years  

I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy after all these years  

Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
It's all gonna fade...  

Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Oh still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

My third and final choice has to be Freddie Mercury, and what better than "Who Wants To Live Forever", from the 1986 film _Highlander_. At this time he was already infected with AIDS and the end of his glittering career was beginning to come into view. Whether this song reflects the awareness of mortality so evident in later numbers cannot be known, but in any case it's a powerful piece.

There's no time for us  
There's no place for us  
What is this thing that builds our dreams  
Yet slips away from us?    
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  

There's no chance for us  
It's all decided for us  
This world has only one  
Sweet moment set aside for us  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Who?    
Who dares to love forever  
Oh, when love must die?  

But touch my tears with your lips  
Touch my world with your fingertips  
And we can have forever  
And we can love forever  
Forever is our today  

Who wants to live forever?  
Who wants to live forever?  
Forever is our today  
Who waits forever anyway?

## Other favourites

I have a fairly wide and eclectic taste in music, though I'm not a fan of harsh, jangly jazz or folk. Neither am I keen on music with to much of an insistent beat, so that rules out most "pop" music as well as oompah. The piano is probably my favourinte instrument; solo guitar I find tedious and trumpets intrusive, though there are notable exceptions to all these. Lush orchestration and "pomp rock" sit somewhere near the top of my list. Queen, Pink Floyd and Genesis, definitely, while I don't much like shouty bands like Status Quo or heavy guitar rock.

I was brought up on classical music but seldom listen to it now, though there are pieces I still enjoy, particularly where classical merges into film themes. The [Warsaw Concerto](https://youtu.be/wbb-jozEdUQ), for example, and almost anything by Ennio Morricone, John Barry or of course Vangelis. The piano concerto is my favourite style of classical music, so Rachmaninov and Rubenstein are high on the list.
