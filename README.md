# My memoirs

This is my story and those of my parents and their parents. It's built using [Storyteller](https://storyteller-ec.netlify.app), whose repository is [here](https://github.com/easycoder/storyteller). Storyteller is a toolkit for building multi-page, single-column static websites composed of text and images. All text is input in Markdown format so no knowledge of HTML is required.
